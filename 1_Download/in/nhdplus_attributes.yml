# NHDPlus Attributes to use as static attributes
# linked to stream sites by COMID

# To explore these and come up with this list, I 
# looked through descriptions of all 4,720 attributes 
# prefixed with `CAT_` using the following code:

# library(tidyverse)
# library(nhdplusTools)
# nhdplus_descriptions <- get_characteristics_metadata() %>% 
#   split(.$themeLabel) %>% 
#   map(~{
#     # CAT = catchment
#     # ACC = accumulated
#     # TOT = total
#     # Using `CAT`
#     select(.x, ID, description) %>% 
#       filter(grepl('^CAT_', ID))
#   })

Best Management Practices:
  # NONE

Chemical:
  # NONE
  # Consider atmospheric deposition of chloride in the future?

Climate:
  - CAT_PRSNOW # percent of precip that is snow, mean 1901-2000
  - CAT_WBM_DT_SNW_2012 # avg & detrended snowfall between 2000-2014

Climate and Water Balance:
  - CAT_WBM_PPT # avg precip from Water Balance Model, 2000-2014
  - CAT_WBM_RUN # avg runoff from WBM 2000-2014
  - CAT_WBM_SNW # avg snowfall from WBM 2000-2014; should be similar to `CAT_WBM_DT_SNW_2012` but not detrended
  - CAT_WBM_STO # avg soil moisture storage from WBM 2000-2014
  # Also has average monthly runoff; could do something with "winter months runoff"?

Climate Water Balance:
  # NONE
  # This includes a timeseries of mean monthly (precip, temp, runoff, etc) per year in model
  # Don't need those though, we are capturing those vars as single, static values per reach

Geology:
  # NONE
  # This includes rock stuff - there is a lot info about rock types and thickness of 
  # different surficial materials. There is also info about Principal Aquifers and 
  # rock hydraulic conductivity. Could consider adding some of these later

Hydrologic:
  - CAT_BFI # baseflow index, % of baseflow to total streamflow)
  - CAT_CONTACT # number of days that infiltrated water resides in the saturated subsurface zone of the basin before discharging into the stream)
  - CAT_EWT # avg depth to water table relative to land surface; if we use this, we should drop the other depth2wt value)
  - CAT_RECHG # mean annual GW recharge
  - CAT_TWI # topographic wetness index = `wetness index is used to predict spatial patterns of soil moisture and depth to the water table` - Wolock and McCabe, 2000)
  # This theme also has some attributes related to runoff, could consider these 
  # instead of earlier ones used from Climate/water balance themes

Hydrologic Modifications:
  - CAT_NDAMS2013 # ?? Number of dams in the catchment

Land Cover:
  # I filtered to NLCD 2019 options but there are many years represented
  - CAT_NLCD19_24 # NLCD 2019 "Developed, high intensity" which equals 80-100% impervious)
  - CAT_NLCD19_22 # NLCD 2019 "Developed, low intensity" which equals 20-49% impervious)
  # There is also "Developed, medium intensity" (50-79% impervious) and "Developed, Open" (<20% impervious)
  # Could also grab other land cover types, including forests, wetlands, etc

  # ALSO: consider using some of these attribute values to remove sites that may be tidal or
  # agricultural? E.g. CAT_ESTUARY, CAT_NLCD19_82 (cultivated crops), CAT_NLCD19_81 (pasture/hay)

Population:
  # NONE
  # The impervious land cover and road density attributes are better measures for our purposes

Regions:
  # Vegetation indices by season in 2012 (0-1, 0 being low vegetation, 1 being high vegetation)
  - CAT_EVI_AMJ_2012 # spring vegetation index
  - CAT_EVI_JAS_2012 # summer vegetation index
  - CAT_EVI_JFM_2012 # winter vegetation index
  - CAT_EVI_OND_2011 # autumn vegetation index

Soils:
  # Soil type by SAND + SILT + CLAY percentages
  - CAT_SANDAVE # sand %
  - CAT_SILTAVE # silt %
  - CAT_CLAYAVE # clay %
  # Other soil characteristics of interest
  - CAT_OM # organic matter, % MAYBE DELETE??
  - CAT_PERMAVE # soil permeability, inches/hour
  - CAT_AWCAVE # available water capacity, fraction
  - CAT_SALINAVE # mean soil salinity
  # Could consider all the attributes about hydrologic soil groups but a lot
  # of those characteristics can be covered from the other soil characteristics

Topographic:
  - CAT_BASIN_SLOPE # avg basin slope, %
  - CAT_STREAM_SLOPE # flowline slope, %
  - CAT_RDX # number of road/stream intersections
  - CAT_TOTAL_ROAD_DENS # road density
  - CAT_STRM_DENS # stream density

Water Use:
  # NONE
