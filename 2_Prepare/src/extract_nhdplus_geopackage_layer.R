#' @title Extract specific layers from the downloaded geopackages
#' @description Open and pull a specific layer from the saved NHD+ geopackages. 
#' Noting that sometimes a COMID does not have all available layers. 
#' 
#' @param in_files a character vector of filepaths to the geopackages downloaded
#' using `nhdplusTools::subset_nhdplus()`.
#' @param gpkg_layer a character value of either `CatchmentSP` or `NHDFlowline_Network` 
#' to indicate which of the geopackage layers to extract. Defaults to `CatchmentSP`.
#' @param crs_out the EPSG code indicating which projection to transform the 
#' output spatial features object to before returning
#' 
#' @returns an `sf` data frame with a row for each spatial feature. Should have the
#' same number of rows as `in_files` but sometimes a geopackage will not have the
#' layer and therefore will not have anything to return.
