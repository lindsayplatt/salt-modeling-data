#' @title Identify event peaks in the SpecCond data
#' @description This was borrowed from code by Galen Gorksi for identifying events
#' in discharge data. We are repurposing this concept for Specific Conductance 
#' values to identify winter storm events that move road salt into streams. The
#' original code written by Galen Gorski can be found at:
#' https://github.com/galengorski/EventPicker/blob/master/appCode/event_picker_functions.R
#' 
#' @param ts_data a data.frame with at least a date-time column and parameter column 
#' of values. Gaps can exist because the denominator of slope will be really large for
#' large gaps and data should not be normalized.
#' @param date_colname a character string specifying the date column name
#' @param param_colname a character string indicating the name used in the columns 
#' for the data values. In this workflow, this is likely `SpecCond`.
#' @param sb_pk_thresh a single numeric value specifying the threshold for detecting
#' a peak based on the rising limb of the peak (`sb` = "slope backward").
#' @param sf_pk_thresh a single numeric value specifying the threshold for detecting
#' a peak based on the falling limb of the peak (`sf` = "slope forward").
#' 
#' @returns a data.frame with new columns for whether a value is a peak and which
#' event it falls within. There may be fewer rows since missing or negative values
#' of the parameter were removed.
